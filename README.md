Build a fully fledged Android Notes Application. Users of your application should be able to create, view, edit and delete notes in your application. Feel free to other sweet features you’d expect in a notes app.

Your app should be based on an existing project from the video series, repo here: https://github.com/lilvinco/NewsApp-SNG
